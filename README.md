![figma text to columns](plugin-promotional-banner.jpg)
## Generate evenly balanced columns from long form text.

### ✨ To Use
- Run the plugin
- Select an element containing text
- Update settings if required
- Click 'Create Columns'

### ❌ If you encounter any errors ❌ 
- Anytime the plugin does not work, the cause is most likely due to invisible/zero width characters in your text element
- To check if this is the case, you can open up the console by clicking Plugins > Development > Open console. Copy and paste the string in the console log to <https://regex101.com/>. If there are any weird characters in there you'll see them highlighted.
- If this happens to you please submit an issue so I can fix it in the regex! Thank you.
